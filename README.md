# React Minesweeper Clone

Just a little project for fun on the weekend to teach my daughter programming concepts.

## TODO

- [ ] Add a tracker for how many bombs are remaining
- [ ] Add a way to set a flag/marker on a spot you think is a bomb
- [ ] Add UI updates like icons, colors, etc. to make everything look better
- [ ] Convert boardState into a React Hook for better (re)usability
